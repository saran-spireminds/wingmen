##The national suicide prevention strategy – key points

To help out, here is a resume of the main points:

- Ministers are pledging to reduce the number of people taking their own lives within two and a half years  
- The strategy promises better support for middle aged men  
- Half of the schools in England will have mental health support teams by April 2025  
- A new national alert system will be launched, aimed at notifying relevant authorities of emerging methods of suicides and risks  
- New guidance will be issued for first responders, recognising new and emerging methods, and how such incidents should be dealt with  
- Near real-time surveillance of trends in suicides will be introduced on a national scale during 2023  
- A pledge to collaborate with countries around the world to target and stop suppliers of dangerous and lethal substances at source  


## Mainstream media coverage of the national suicide prevention strategy

This announcement has rightly garnered some great attention across the airwaves, not least where it made the top of the day’s news on BBC 5 Live at 6pm today. You can listen back to the show on BBC Sounds.

The programme reminded us of the shocking statistic that in April 2021, over 5,500 people in the UK took their own lives, and 75% of these were men.

For the programme, the BBC’s Clare McDonnell interviewed Luke Ambler, the founder of Andy’s Man Club. He spoke inspirationally about why the CIC was set up, and how it has grown over the years. Just look at some of the stats:

- There are now 150 Andy’s Man Club groups  
- 3,200 men are meeting every Monday at 7pm right across the UK  
- AMC is now supported by 1,200 trained facilitators  

During the interview, Luke made some great points, including:

- The power of providing a connection to someone in need  
- The importance of community support for those with mental health issues  
- The fact that whilst social media makes us all feel more connected, this does not mean it provides the connection you need, when you need it  
- That Andy’s Man Club operates a policy of zero judgment for anyone wanting to attend 

## Wingmen’s perspective on the national suicide prevention strategy

Wingmen wholeheartedly approve of the strategy that has been announced today. The time has gone where we as a nation can pretend that the problem doesn’t exist.

We trust that there will be the funding and resources available to support the strategy. We will track the progress of this new strategy and report back on these pages. We have seen that a new grant has been launched to accompany the strategy, which on the face of it is great news. We trust that the fund will be used with responsibility and care and will mean that there is money available where it is needed.

During the interview on 5 Live, Luke spoke openly, honestly and movingly about the journey he and his family have been on; the phrase that he used that resonated with me most was:  
**“If he had just spoken to someone, he would still be here”.**

We understand that some people may not want to speak to their own friends and family, or other authorities. However, we believe passionately in the power of connection. This is why Wingmen exists. **We’re here to listen.**
